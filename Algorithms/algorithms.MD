- Brute Force Algorithms (bruteforce.go)

## Brute Force Algorithms
Brute Force Algorithms are known for wide applicability and simplicity in solving complex problems.  They do not provide efficient algorithms.  The algorithms are slow and non-performant.

### Use-cases
Searching, string matching, and matrix multiplication.  Single computational tasks can also be solved using brute force algorithms.
