Implemented so far:
- Brute Force Algorithms (bruteforce.go)
- Divide and Conquer Algorithms (divide.go)

## Brute Force Algorithms
Brute Force Algorithms are known for wide applicability and simplicity in solving complex problems.  They do not provide efficient algorithms.  The algorithms are slow and non-performant.

### Use-cases
Searching, string matching, and matrix multiplication.  Single computational tasks can also be solved using brute force algorithms.

## Divide and Conquer Algorithms
Divide and Conquer algorithms break a complex problem into smaller problems to solve, and then solves them.  The approach is to recursively solve the sub-problems and merge the solutions of the sub-problems.

### Use-cases
Recursion, quick sort, binary search, fast Fourier transform, and merge sort are good examples of divide and conquer algorithms.  
Memory use is efficent with these algorithms.  Performance is sometimes an issue in the case of recursion.  On multiprocessor machines, these algorithms can be executed on different processors after breaking them down into sub-problems.
